## Stack 
####  A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile. You can visualize a stack as a stack of plates. The first plate you put down is going to be the last plate you pick up.<u>(LIFO, Last In First Out)</u>
#### Push and Pop are the primary operations that are performed on stacks. When you place an item on top of the stack it is called <u> 'pushing' </u> it. When you place an item on top of the stack it is called <u>'popping'</u> it
	Methods: push, pop, isEmpty, and isFull
